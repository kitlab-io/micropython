# JEM IMU Kit
- Kit showing how to use the BNO055 IMU Sensor
- Specs: https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/smart-sensor-systems/bno055/
- BNO055 is a smart sensor combining accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer and orientation software

## Instructions
- Flash kit to JEM
- Navigate to **RC** tab on Web or Mobile App and interact with the IMU sensor
- Edit the **kits/imu/imu.vue** file to update your kit UI and then reload the **RC** tab to see changes live

## Tutorial 1
In this tutorial we will add a new interrupt feature to our IMU kit. Whenever you move or disturb the resting JEM device a sound will be produced from the buzzer. This demonstrates the interrupt feature of the JEM IMU. An interrupt is an electrical event generated by the IMU chip that is caught by the JEM. The JEM will be programmed to watch for this event and make a sound each time it's caught.

- Use code in 'kits/imu/tutorial_1'
   + This sub directory has files that include a new button element in the vue file and a new function in the python file
   + Look for the code between comments 'Tutorial_1' and 'Tutorial_1 !' in each file to see the new code
   ```txt 
         # Tutorial_1
          some new py code
         # Tutorial_1 !

         or 

         // Tutorial_1
         some new js code
         // Tutorial_1 !
   ``` 
- Replace 'imu.py' and 'imu.vue' in 'kits/imu/' with the same files in 'kits/imu/tutorial_1'
- Flash the new code to JEM and reconnect
- Navigate to the 'RC' page and press the 'START' button to start the kit
- Place the JEM on a table or other hard surface and then tap or move it and see if it makes a sound
